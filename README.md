### What I Do

I lead research and development of **multi-modal agentic AI systems** that fuse video, audio, and text intelligence to solve real industrial challenges — from anomaly detection and smart monitoring to predictive maintenance.

My research interests are:

🤖 **Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems** · ⚙️ **Distributed Optimization** · 📡 **Federated Learning** · 🔐 **Differential Privacy**
